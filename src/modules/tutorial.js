    text: `Hi! I'm duck.js. Welcome to Creatures of Habit! I'll show you around and help you get the most out of this app.`,
  },
  {
    text: `For starters, you need a creature! Click on the "New Creature" button in the top left corner.`
  },
  {
    text: `At the top of the form to the left, you can choose a creature from the dropdown selection. (For this demo, choose Charizard! Also, typing helps)`
  },
  {
    text: `To the right of the creature you selected, if there's an alternate version, you can choose one from the dropdown selection.`
  },
  {
    text: `After that, you can choose up to three more creatures. This will be the evolution line.`
  },
  {
    text: `Choose a purpose for your creature. This determines how much EXP your creature needs to level up!`
  },
  {
    text: `Now you can give your creature a name! Could be something witty, historic, or your own name if you like. It'd be hard to beat "duck.js," though...`
  },
  {
    text: `You can then give your creature a title. E.g., "Pianist", "Engineer", or "Student." Then you can click the "Create Creature" button and see your creation come to life!`
  },
  {
    text: `There it is! Isn't that neat?! Let's add some habits for your creature! Click the gold "View Info" button on your creature's card.`
  },
  {
    text: `To the right, you can add some habits, time-based or not, and varying in concentration required. 
      E.g., practicing piano requires more focus than warming up your hands.`
  },
  {
    text: `Awesome! Now you can complete a habit just by clicking the "Complete" button to the right of each habit.`
  },
  {
    text: `Aw yeah, level 2! Now your creature can grow with you!`
  },
  {
    text: `Creatures evolve at levels 15, 30, and 50.`
  },
  {
    text: `If you want to edit your creature, you can do so from this same page. Just click the gold "Edit Creature" button on your creature's card.`
  },
  {
    text: `This page is really similar to the create form. If you can't change a creature in the evolution line, that's because it already passed. 
      Can't change the past, can we?`
  },
  {
    text: `That's it for the tutorial! 
    Click "next" below or "Skip Tutorial" at the top right to create an account and make some new creatures!
    (we won't sell your data or track you)`
